// Let's see what is TypeScript?


What is TypeScript?
    -> TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, allowing you to catch errors early during development rather than at runtime. It was developed by Microsoft to improve JavaScriptâ€™s capabilities, especially for large-scale applications.


Key Features of TypeScript

    1.Static Typing: Unlike JavaScript, TypeScript allows you to define types for variables, functions, and properties. This helps catch type-related errors early.

Example : let message: string = "Hello, TypeScript!";

    2.Interfaces and Classes: TypeScript supports advanced features like interfaces and classes, which enhance object-oriented programming and code organization.

Example : interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

class Employee implements Person {
    constructor(public name: string, public age: number, public designation: string) {}
}

    3.Modern JavaScript Features: TypeScript includes support for the latest JavaScript features (such as ES6/ES7) before they are widely available in browsers.

Example : const add = (a: number, b: number): number => a + b;
